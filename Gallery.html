          Mark, a 40-year-old accountant, had spent years with little
          <br />physical activity, leading to weight gain and fatigue.<br />
          Through Fitness Fusion, he committed to a simple workout routine
          <br />with strength and cardio three times a week, along with<br />
          a balanced diet that fit his lifestyle. Six months later, <br />Mark
          has lost 20 pounds, gained muscle, and feels more<br />
          energized and confident than ever.

          gradually adding cardio and weight training. One year later,<br />
          Alex has regained his mobility, dropped 15 pounds, and is<br />
          stronger than ever, proud of his steady progress.
