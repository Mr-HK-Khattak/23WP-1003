            <p>

              carbs, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals in the right<br />
              proportions. It supports energy levels, muscle health, and
              immunity,<br />
              helping to maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of
              chronic illnesses.<br />

          <h2>Proteins</h2>
          <p>
            Boost muscle recovery and build strength with high-quality<br />
            proteins. Include lean meats, fish, eggs, and plant-based<br />
            options like beans and tofu in your diet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nutrition Tip: </strong>Try to consume protein within 30
            minutes of a workout<br />
            to maximize muscle repair and growth. Aim for a variety of sources
            <br />to get a full range of amino acids.
          </p>

        <div class="carbohydrates-category">
          <h2>carbohydrates</h2>
          <p>
            Carbs are essential for fueling energy and supporting endurance.<br />
            Choose whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to keep <br />energy
            levels stable and avoid sugar crashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nutrition Tip: </strong>Opt for complex carbs like oats,
            quinoa, and brown rice, <br />which provide a slower energy release
            and keep you fuller longer,<br />
            helping sustain your workouts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="fats-category">
          <h2>Fats</h2>
          <p>
            Healthy fats support your metabolism, brain health, and overall<br />
            wellness. Include sources like avocado, nuts, olive oil,<br />
            and fatty fish like salmon in your diet.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nutrition Tip: </strong>Donâ€™t fear fats! Healthy fats can
            aid<br />
            in nutrient absorption and hormone regulation. Just <br />keep
            portions moderate to balance calorie intake.

        <div class="vitamins-category">
          <h2>vitamins & Minerals</h2>
          <p>
            Micronutrients play a key role in keeping your body functioning<br />
            optimally. Focus on a diet rich in colorful fruits <br />and
            vegetables to get a variety of vitamins and minerals.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nutrition Tip: </strong>Eat a rainbow! Each color in fruits
            and veggies brings<br />
            unique antioxidants and benefits. Include leafy<br />
            greens, berries, carrots, and citrus fruits daily.
